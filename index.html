                   CHARLES KONDEK is the recipient of the prestigious MARC BLITZSTEIN MEMORIAL AWARD for music theater presented by the AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND LETTERS.<br><br> ESTHER, written with HUGO WEISGALL and premiered by the New York City Opera at Lincoln Center, was proclaimed by<strong> New York Magazine</strong> “a work that can now be placed among the very finest operas we have,” and<strong> Time Magazine</strong> termed ESTHER “a powerful evening of music theatre.” Martin Bernheimer of <strong>The Los Angeles Times</strong> suggested ESTHER “may be a masterpiece.”<br><br>

                   KONDEK also wrote the libretto for BETWEEN TWO WORLDS, with music by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer SHULAMIT RAN, commissioned and produced by the Lyric Opera of Chicago. KONDEK and RAN have just finished up a new version of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK, which will premiere at Indiana University.<br><br>

                   In addition to BORGIA INFAMI, his collaborations with composer HAROLD BLUMENFELD include the farcical ensemble opera FOURSCORE, the opera-bagatelle BREAKFAST WALTZES, and SEASONS IN HELL, whose libretto was described by <strong>The American Record Guide</strong> as “an ingenious display of literary virtuosity.” <strong>The Cincinnati Enquirer</strong> called the SEASONS IN HELL “a fascinating coming-together of words, music and imagery.”
